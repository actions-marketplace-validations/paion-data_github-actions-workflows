Github Actions Workflows
========================

### YAML & Markdown Link

This was inspired by [Sous Chefs' linting action] and includes 3 checks

1. [YAML lint](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/yaml-lint-action) which requires a
   [config file](https://github.com/paion-data/astraios/blob/master/.yamllint) at project root
2. [Markdown lint](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdownlint-mdl-action) (no config file needed)
3. [Markdown link check](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check) with a config files 
   [1](https://github.com/paion-data/astraios/blob/master/.mdlrc) and
   [2](https://github.com/paion-data/astraios/blob/master/markdownlint.rb) both at project root

Here is an example:

```yml
---
name: My GitHub Workflow

"on":
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  yml-md-style:
    uses: QubitPi/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/yml-and-md-style-checks.yml@master
```

### Cypress E2E Tests

**Cypress E2E Tests** offers developers Actions that provide a way to automate, customize, and execute end-to-end tests 
within a GitHub project. 

This action helps ease the setup of Cypress in a GitHub Action. The action provides dependency installation via
**yarn**, scanning of test specs, _running each spec in parallel_, and upload test screenshots and video on test
failure.

The example below is a very simple setup:

1. Put all **.spec.cy.ts** test files under "cypress/e2e" directory
2. Have a file at the root of project with the name **.env.test**, which will contain all the environment variables used
   during the test. The action will rename the ".env.test" name to the
   regular _.env_ file
3. Place a **test-setup.sh** file under _.github/test-setup.sh_ directory for any pre-test setup. For example, to start
   a [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) server and
   [run e2e only after the server starts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   cd packages/lowdb
   yarn install
   yarn start ../../.github/db.json &
   yarn wait-on-server
   ```

   Don't forget to make the script executable by running

   ```bash
   chmod u+x .github/test-setup.sh
   ```

4. Use Cypress E2E Tests workflow:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: My GitHub Workflow
   
   "on":
      pull_request:
      push:
         branches:
            - master
   
   jobs:
     e2e-tests:
       uses: QubitPi/github-actions-workflows/.github/workflows/cypress-e2e-tests.yml@master
   ```
